            <div>What is a Convolutional Neural Network?</div>
            Convolutional neural networks extend the already expansive neural 
            network model, by incorporating layers which are able to reduce
            image data down to single feature values, to later be passed to 
            a standard hidden layer, then finally an output layer. These layers
            form a convolutional layer. The convolutional layer consists of 
            transformations such as pooling, which takes the average of a region
            of pixels and reduces it to a smaller region. By doing these kinds 
            of transformations repeatedly, the model is able to reduce all parts
            of an image into a vector of feature values, which are then fed to 
            a standard neural network.
