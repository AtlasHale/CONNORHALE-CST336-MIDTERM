            Natural language processing is the process of writing a program which
            is capable of understanding human language, in text or speech form.
            These programs have a wide variety of uses, such as machine translation,
            document analysis, web scraping, etc. The process begins, like all other
            machine learning, with training data. A sentence could be fed to a model,
            and from it the sentence would be segmented, tokenized, lematized, and 
            then the information can be extracted. NLP is one of the oldest forms 
            of machine learning, and in fact was what kicked off the now popular
            neural net structure.
