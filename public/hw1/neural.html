            A neural network is a system of nodes, connected by edges, 
            through which data can be passed and transformed. The idea is
            similar to the function of the brain, which consists of 
            a series of neurons, connected by nerves, through which electrical
            signal is passed, forming human thought. In a neural network, data
            is transformed into some numeric feature, and at each node the data
            is multiplied by a function, often a polynomial, and a bias value
            is added to it. This transformation continues through all the hidden
            layers of nodes, until it finally reaches an output layer, which can
            be used to make predictions. The function at each node is what is 
            trained during the training step, in order to reduce the error of 
            predictions. Specifically, the coefficients in the function, sometimes
            called the weights of a node, are changed, along with the bias.
